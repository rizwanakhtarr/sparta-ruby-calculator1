### Sparta Ruby Calculator
### Tasks
Your task is to write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.

First you will need to ask the user for which calculator they want to use
Then you will need to ask the user for the numbers to operate on.
Then you need to work out what to do with the numbers, depending on what operation they choose.
Basic:

Additon
Multiplication
Division
Subtraction
Advanced:

Power
Square root


### Challenges
It was difficult to apply the advanced calculator at first but then I realised my end statement was not inputted correctly

```
case operation
when "1"
  p "the sum of #{numb1} and #{numb2} is:"
  puts numb1 + numb2
when "2"
  p "the subtraction of #{numb1} and #{numb2} is:"
  puts numb1 - numb2
when "3"
  p "the multiplication of #{numb1} and #{numb2} is:"
  puts numb1 * numb2
when "4"
  p "the division of #{numb1} and #{numb2} is:"
  puts numb1 / numb2
end
end



```
